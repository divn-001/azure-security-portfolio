# Governance and Landing Zones

## Purpose
This section focuses on enforcing secure Azure architecture through governance
and standardized landing zone design.

The goal is to prevent insecure configurations at scale.

---

## Scope (Strictly Enforced)

### In Scope
- Azure Policy
- Management groups
- Subscription design
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Detection logic
- Security alerts
- Manual configuration walkthroughs

---

## Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. Enforce Security Standards
- Prevent insecure deployments
- Apply consistent guardrails
- Reduce configuration drift

### 2. Design Scalable Azure Architecture
- Organize subscriptions and management groups
- Align governance to enterprise scale

---

## Execution Philosophy
Governance controls focus on **prevention**, not remediation.
Policies are designed to be understandable and maintainable.

---

## Success Criteria
- Insecure configurations are blocked by design
- Governance scales across subscriptions
- Architecture decisions are repeatable
