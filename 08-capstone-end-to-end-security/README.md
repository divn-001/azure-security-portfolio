## Scope (Strictly Enforced)

### In Scope
- Threat scenarios
- Detection → response flow
- Control gap analysis

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Standalone labs
- Isolated configurations

---

## Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. Think Across Security Domains
- Correlate identity, detection, and governance
- Identify control gaps

### 2. Improve Security Posture Iteratively
- Apply lessons learned
- Propose architectural improvements

---

## Execution Philosophy
Security is treated as a **continuous lifecycle**, not isolated controls.

---

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end scenarios are clearly documented
- Control improvements are justified
- Decisions can be defended in interviews
