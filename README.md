This portfolio demonstrates practical, real-world Azure security skills across the end-to-end security lifecycle.  
It is designed to show competence in securing cloud identities, enforcing governance, building detections, responding to threats, and automating controls — exactly the responsibilities of an Azure Security Engineer.
