Azure Security Engineering &amp; Architecture Portfolio (SecOps)

## Overview
This repository contains a hands-on Azure security engineering portfolio focused on **identity, detection, cloud posture, and secure architecture**.

It is designed to demonstrate practical, real-world skills required for **mid-level Azure / Cloud Security Engineer roles**, with a strong emphasis on:
- Reducing security incidents through preventive controls
- Engineering secure-by-default cloud environments
- Translating SOC findings into long-term security improvements

## Background
I am currently a **Security Analyst (SOC-focused)** with hands-on experience in detection, investigation, and incident response.  
This portfolio represents my deliberate transition into **Security Engineering and Cloud Security Architecture**.

## Certifications
- AZ-500 – Azure Security Engineer Associate  
- SC-200 – Microsoft Security Operations Analyst  
- SC-100 – Cybersecurity Architect (in progress)

## Portfolio Structure
Each project focuses on a real security engineering responsibility commonly seen in Azure security job descriptions.

| Project | Focus Area |
|------|-----------|
| Identity & Zero Trust | Conditional Access, MFA, PIM |
| Detection Engineering | Microsoft Sentinel, KQL, automation |
| Secure Admin Access | Bastion, JIT, attack surface reduction |
| Cloud Workload Protection | Defender for Cloud, posture management |
| Landing Zone Governance | Azure Policy, RBAC, management groups |
| Incident-Driven Architecture | Engineering from real SOC incidents |
| DevSecOps Automation | Policy-as-code, CI/CD security |

## How to Use This Repository
